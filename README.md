# Khambe

A port of [Flambe](https://github.com/aduros/flambe/) working in [Kha](//github.com/KTXSoftware/Kha). This is a work in progess. Khambe has no plans to support canvas. If you looking for canvas support I highly recommend [Flambe](//github.com/aduros/flambe). This project is looking to support all the native platforms that Kha offers and add additional graphical features while keeping the source outside of platform/kha as original as possible.
