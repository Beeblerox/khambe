# Khambe

A port of [Flambe](https://github.com/aduros/flambe/) working in [Kha](https://github.com/KTXSoftware/Kha). This is a work in progess. Khambe has no plans to support canvas. If you looking for canvas support I highly recommend Flambe. This project is looking to support all the native platforms that Kha offers and add additional graphical features while keeping the source outside of platform/kha as original as possible.

### Goals
* Target Android-native
* Target IOS
* Target OSX
* Target WebGL
* Custom Pipelines
* 3D sprites
* Tinting

### Examples
* [Lighting Pipeline](https://github.com/sourcreme/khambe-example)

Looking for contributers and criticism.
